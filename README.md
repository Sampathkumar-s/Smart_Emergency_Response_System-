Smart Emergency Response System for Road Accidents


🚨 **Overview**
Road accidents remain a leading cause of fatalities worldwide, with delayed emergency response being a critical factor in the loss of lives. This project presents a Smart Emergency Response System for Road Accidents that integrates cutting-edge sensor technology to automatically detect accidents and alert emergency services, potentially saving up to 50% of accident victims through rapid response.

🎯** Problem Statement**
Road accidents cause approximately 180,000 deaths annually in India

50% of fatalities could be prevented with prompt emergency response within the first hour

Remote and low-traffic areas often experience delayed emergency assistance

Traditional accident reporting relies on human intervention, causing critical delays

💡** Solution**
Our system eliminates human dependency in accident reporting by providing:

Automatic accident detection using vibration sensors

Precise location tracking with GPS technology

Instant emergency alerts via GSM communication

Real-time notifications to emergency contacts and healthcare services

🔧 **Key Features**
Core Components
